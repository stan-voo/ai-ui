# Humans think in threads, not files
*○ principle*

People think in situations, goals, people, and decisions — not files, paths, and folders. Cognitive units include: "launching a new product," "that long conversation about marketing," "how do I price this?" No one naturally thinks "open the correct folder and file."

## Why it matters

This insight defines what the replacement for file-based interfaces must look like. Any new interface must be organized around human cognitive units, not storage units.

## Connections

This principle drives the design of [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]], which organize work around ongoing threads of thought rather than static file trees. It explains [[files-are-storage-primitives-not-cognitive-primitives|Files are storage primitives, not cognitive primitives]] from the human side — if humans think in threads, then files are a translation layer, not a native format. It also informs [[thread-workspace-vs-project|Thread Workspace vs Project]], clarifying how thread-based organization differs from traditional project structures.

# Knowledge Created in Conversations Is Fragile
*△ problem*

Knowledge is increasingly created inside AI chat conversations, voice notes, meetings, and problem-solving threads. This knowledge is high-value but extremely fragile. Important decisions, technical solutions, and insights are buried inside chat windows and difficult to find later. Documentation requires manual effort that most people don't do.

## Why it matters

As more thinking happens in AI conversations, more knowledge is at risk of being lost. The gap between where knowledge is created (conversations) and where it needs to live (trusted memory) grows wider.

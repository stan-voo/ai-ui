# Four-Layer Architecture
*◇ concept*

The Four-Layer Architecture stacks four distinct layers, each building on the one below:

1. **Plain Text Substrate** — Markdown files, portable and vendor-independent
2. **Thread Workspaces** — situations and threads replacing folder navigation
3. **Human-Governed Memory** — AI proposes, humans confirm
4. **Context-Aware Retrieval** — retrieval by threads, decisions, and questions, not file paths

## Why it matters

Preserves the sovereignty and portability of plain text while adding the cognitive layers (threads, governance, context) that files alone cannot provide. Each layer has a distinct purpose.

## Connections

Layer 1 is the [[immutable-raw-layer|Immutable Raw Layer]], providing the portable, vendor-independent foundation. Layer 2 is [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]], where situations replace folders as the primary navigation unit. Layer 3 implements [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]], ensuring AI memory is governed rather than automatic. Layer 4 addresses [[retrieval-is-context-blind|Retrieval is context-blind]] by making retrieval aware of threads, decisions, and open questions. The entire architecture embodies [[plain-text-right-substrate-wrong-interface|Plain text is the right substrate, wrong interface]] — keeping what works about plain text while building what it lacks on top.

# Context Chips
*◆ pattern*

When typing a prompt, removable and addable chips appear above the input: [Thread: Server-side tracking] [Decision: target Shopify] [Doc: landing page]. Users can remove a chip, add more, or expand a chip to preview content. This mirrors how humans think: "I want the AI to consider *this* and *that*."

## How it works

Chips represent semantic context objects (threads, decisions, memories, artifacts, people). Each chip is a tangible handle on what the AI will know. The user interacts with meaning, not files.

## Connections

Primary UI element of [[context-composer|Context Composer]]. Works alongside [[swipe-to-add-context|Swipe to add context]] and [[why-is-this-included|Why is this included?]]. Addresses [[context-assembly-is-the-new-bottleneck|Context assembly is the new bottleneck]].

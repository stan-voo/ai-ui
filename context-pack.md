# Context Pack
*◇ concept*

A Context Pack is a curated set of threads, decisions, documents, memories, and open questions assembled for a specific AI interaction. It represents what the AI should know *right now* — not everything it could know. It is the first-class object in a PKM system redesigned for AI.

## Why it matters

Replaces the vague notion of "context window" with a concrete, human-curated unit. Makes context visible and editable instead of implicit.

## Connections

Central to the [[context-composer|Context Composer]] interface, the Context Pack is the object that gets assembled before any AI interaction. It feeds into [[the-new-knowledge-loop|The New Knowledge Loop]] as the bridge between stored knowledge and AI reasoning. Its existence directly addresses [[context-assembly-is-the-new-bottleneck|Context assembly is the new bottleneck]] by making assembly explicit and repeatable. Context Packs are built from objects living in [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]], pulling together the relevant pieces of an evolving situation into a coherent package for a specific moment of thinking.

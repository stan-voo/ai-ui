# Structure as User's Responsibility Fails
*△ problem*

In Unix-style knowledge systems, users must decide where to store things, maintain folder hygiene, remember naming conventions, and engineer their own workflows. This works for engineers but fails for most humans under cognitive load. Structure becomes yet another thing to manage rather than a tool that helps.

## Why it matters

If the system requires users to maintain its organization, most won't. The knowledge base degrades over time, not because the tool is bad, but because it demands ongoing structural labor.

Solved by [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]] and [[overlapping-contexts-replace-hierarchy|Overlapping contexts replace hierarchy]]. Dissolved by [[when-should-this-knowledge-be-used|When should this knowledge be used?]] reframe.

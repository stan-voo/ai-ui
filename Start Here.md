# Start Here

## Have you ever wished your AI just... remembered?

You've told ChatGPT about your project three times this week. You had a great conversation last month and can't find it. You know the AI could help more — if only it knew what you've already told it.

You're not doing anything wrong. The tools are.

The fundamental insight: **you don't need to organize if you can assemble context on demand.** What if the AI could gather exactly the right context — and you just confirmed it?

## Here's what's actually going wrong

- Your best ideas are trapped in old chat windows that nobody will ever reopen. [[knowledge-created-in-conversations-is-fragile|Knowledge created in conversations is fragile]]
- The AI quietly builds a picture of you, but nobody checks if it's accurate. [[ai-memory-is-unreviewed|AI memory is unreviewed]]
- Small mistakes and outdated info pile up until the AI's "memory" works against you. [[context-rot|Context rot]]
- You spend real time copy-pasting, re-explaining, and hunting for old threads instead of thinking. [[manual-context-curation-is-hidden-labor|Manual context curation is hidden labor]]

## What if you could tell the AI what to focus on — in 3 seconds?

Imagine small chips above your chat showing exactly what the AI knows right now — your project brief, last week's decisions, your preferences. [[context-chips|Context Chips]]

You can remove, add, or adjust any of them with a tap. [[swipe-to-add-context|Swipe to add context]] · [[context-strength-slider|Context Strength Slider]]

The AI suggests what might be relevant. You decide what stays. [[propose-adjust-send|Propose → Adjust → Send]]

## What if the AI only remembered things you approved?

After a conversation, the AI suggests things worth saving — decisions, preferences, facts about your work. [[ai-proposes-memory-candidates|AI proposes memory candidates]]

You swipe to approve, edit, or dismiss. Nothing gets stored without your say-so. [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]]

Over time, you build a personal library of trusted knowledge that actually makes your AI better. [[trusted-knowledge-layer|Trusted Knowledge Layer]]

## The bigger picture (for the curious)

This is part of a larger rethinking of how people and AI work together — one where you stay in control of what the AI knows, and the AI gets genuinely better at helping you over time.

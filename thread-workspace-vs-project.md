# Thread Workspace vs Project
*◇ concept*

Thread Workspaces are distinct from projects. Projects are task-centric, deadline-centric, and outcome-centric. Thread Workspaces are thinking-centric, context-centric, long-lived, messy, and non-linear. Many important life threads (career direction, learning, strategy, personal patterns) never become "projects" but still need a persistent home.

## Why it matters

Existing productivity tools force everything into projects or tasks. Thread Workspaces acknowledge that much of human thinking doesn't fit that model and provide a home for long-running, evolving concerns.

## Connections

This distinction refines the concept of [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]] by clarifying what they are not. It challenges the project metaphor embedded in tools like Linear and Notion, which assume all meaningful work has deadlines and deliverables. The deeper insight connects to [[humans-think-in-threads-not-files|Humans think in threads, not files]] — people carry ongoing threads of concern that persist across projects, tools, and years.

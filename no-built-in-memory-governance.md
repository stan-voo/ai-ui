# No Built-In Memory Governance
*△ problem*

Unix-style systems store everything equally. There is no native layer for promoting decisions, confirming insights, expiring outdated beliefs, or preventing narrative drift. Without governance, archives grow while understanding decays. The more you store, the less you can trust.

## Why it matters

Storage without governance produces noise. The system needs a way to distinguish signal from noise — not through deletion, but through validation and promotion.

## Connections

Core architectural gap addressed by [[memory-is-governance-not-storage|Memory is governance, not storage]]. Filled by [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]]. Produces [[trusted-knowledge-layer|Trusted Knowledge Layer]] when solved. Related to [[retrieval-is-context-blind|Retrieval is context-blind]].

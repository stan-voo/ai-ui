# Cross-System Identity Layer
*◇ concept*

Instead of each AI assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini) maintaining its own separate, unvalidated model of who you are, a Cross-System Identity Layer becomes the single source of truth for your digital identity. Any connected AI reads from and writes to this layer, and nothing enters your validated profile without approval.

## Why it matters

AI memory features shipped across all major platforms in 2024-2025, but each maintains isolated, unreviewed user models. As AI moves from chat tool to life infrastructure, a unified identity layer prevents fragmentation and ensures accuracy.

## Connections

This layer is the future evolution of the [[ai-memory-is-unreviewed|AI memory is unreviewed]] problem, taken to its logical conclusion across platforms. It extends [[cascading-validation|Cascading Validation]] beyond a single tool into a cross-platform governance model. The design builds on [[anti-automation-pro-sovereignty|Anti-automation, pro-sovereignty]], ensuring users own their identity rather than delegating it. It requires [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]] as the governance mechanism that prevents any AI from unilaterally updating your profile.

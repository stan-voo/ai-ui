# AI Proposes Memory Candidates
*◆ pattern*

AI analyzes raw transcripts and extracts candidates: decisions, technical playbooks, ideas, tasks, recurring patterns. Nothing is stored as "memory" automatically. AI proposes, humans decide. The AI does the extraction work; the human does the governance work.

## How it works

After a conversation or voice note is captured in the [[immutable-raw-layer|Immutable Raw Layer]], AI processes it and generates candidate memory items. These enter the [[proactive-memory-review|Proactive Memory Review]] queue for human validation.

## Connections

Core of [[memory-is-governance-not-storage|Memory is governance, not storage]]. Feeds into [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]]. Processes content from [[immutable-raw-layer|Immutable Raw Layer]]. Same "propose" philosophy as [[propose-adjust-send|Propose → Adjust → Send]].

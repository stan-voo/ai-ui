# Retrieval Is Context-Blind
*△ problem*

Grep, full-text search, and semantic search are excellent at finding text. But they do not answer: What decision did we ultimately make? What is still unresolved? Which ideas were rejected? Which reasoning is current vs obsolete? Search retrieves data. It does not govern meaning.

## Why it matters

As knowledge bases grow, the gap between "finding text" and "understanding context" becomes critical. More search results actually make the problem worse without governance.

## Connections

Why [[context-is-curation-not-search|Context is curation, not search]] is a key principle. Addressed by Layer 4 of [[four-layer-architecture|Four-Layer Architecture]]. Motivates [[context-composer|Context Composer]] over traditional search. Related to [[no-built-in-memory-governance|No built-in memory governance]].

# Overlapping Contexts Replace Hierarchy
*◇ concept*

In a thread-centric world, a note can belong to a person, a thread, a decision, and a theme simultaneously. Instead of hierarchical folders, you get overlapping contexts forming a graph — but the user never sees "the graph." They see threads, timelines, decisions, and open loops.

## Why it matters

Folder hierarchies force single-classification. Real knowledge is multi-contextual. Overlapping contexts enable the same piece of knowledge to surface wherever it is relevant.

## Connections

This concept replaces the folder hierarchy critiqued in [[files-are-storage-primitives-not-cognitive-primitives|Files are storage primitives, not cognitive primitives]], where the single-parent constraint of folders distorts how knowledge actually relates. Overlapping contexts are what make [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]] powerful — a single note can appear in multiple threads without duplication. The [[visual-context-map|Visual Context Map]] offers one UI approach for making these overlapping relationships navigable without exposing raw graph complexity.

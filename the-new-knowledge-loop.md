# The New Knowledge Loop
*◇ concept*

The New Knowledge Loop describes how information flows in an AI-augmented PKM system: Raw Information → Stored in PKM Substrate → Assembled into Context Packs → AI Reasoning → New Knowledge → Promoted to Trusted Memory. Each cycle compounds understanding rather than just accumulating files.

## Why it matters

Traditional knowledge management is linear (capture, organize, retrieve). This loop is generative — AI creates new knowledge from curated context, and the best of it feeds back as trusted memory.

## Connections

The loop starts with the [[immutable-raw-layer|Immutable Raw Layer]], where everything is captured without filtering. It passes through [[context-pack|Context Pack]] assembly, where humans curate what matters for a given reasoning task. The outputs flow to the [[trusted-knowledge-layer|Trusted Knowledge Layer]] through [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]], completing the cycle. This loop is the operational heart of [[pkm-as-context-operating-system|PKM as Context Operating System]], turning static knowledge stores into compounding intelligence.

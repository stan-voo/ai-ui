# Chat UI Is Also Not the Answer
*△ problem*

Chat interfaces are linear, ephemeral, hard to navigate, and hard to reuse. They are conversation-centric, not knowledge-centric. Neither the file/folder metaphor (implementation-centric) nor the chat metaphor (conversation-centric) serves knowledge work well. We're stuck between two outdated interface paradigms.

## Why it matters

Recognizing that chat UI is also insufficient prevents building "a better chat app" and redirects toward the actual goal: [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]] that are knowledge-centric.

## Connections

Alongside [[files-are-storage-primitives-not-cognitive-primitives|Files are storage primitives, not cognitive primitives]], defines the two-sided problem. Motivates [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]] as the alternative. Explains why [[file-folder-metaphor-is-transitional|File-folder metaphor is transitional]] applies to chat too.

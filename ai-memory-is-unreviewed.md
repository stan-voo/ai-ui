# AI Memory Is Unreviewed
*△ problem*

Every major AI assistant now builds a persistent model of who you are — your job, preferences, goals, communication style. This model shapes every response. But nobody reviews it. AI memory is generated automatically from conversations, often inferring facts that may be wrong, outdated, or incomplete. The existing interfaces (a settings page buried three clicks deep) are reactive and tedious.

## Why it matters

The more you use AI, the more these errors compound. As AI moves from chat tool to life infrastructure, the cost of an inaccurate user model grows from annoying to consequential.

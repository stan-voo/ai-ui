# Why Is This Included?
*◆ pattern*

Every context item should answer: Why is this here? Where did it come from? Example: "Decision: Target Shopify first / Reason: Used in 4 related conversations / Last confirmed: 3 days ago." Transparency prevents "creepy AI memory" and builds trust.

## How it works

Each [[context-chips|Context Chips]] chip can be expanded to show provenance — why the system suggested it, how many times it's been referenced, and when it was last confirmed.

## Connections

Trust mechanism for [[context-composer|Context Composer]]. Implements [[anti-automation-pro-sovereignty|Anti-automation, pro-sovereignty]] at the UI level. Builds user confidence in [[trusted-knowledge-layer|Trusted Knowledge Layer]].

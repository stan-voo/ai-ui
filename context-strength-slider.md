# Context Strength Slider
*◆ pattern*

A simple slider control: Minimal — Balanced — Deep. Behind the scenes: Minimal = only current thread. Balanced = thread + key memories. Deep = + related threads + artifacts. Simple mental model, powerful effect. Users control context depth without thinking about tokens or files.

## How it works

A three-position slider in the [[context-composer|Context Composer]]. Each position maps to a progressively broader context assembly. Users adjust based on the complexity of their request.

## Connections

Part of [[context-composer|Context Composer]]. Respects [[context-must-be-adjustable-in-under-5-seconds|Context must be adjustable in under 5 seconds]]. Complements [[context-chips|Context Chips]] for fine-tuning. Abstracts away the complexity of [[context-pack|Context Pack]] assembly.

# Context Assembly Is the New Bottleneck
*△ problem*

The bottleneck in AI-assisted knowledge work is no longer structuring or storing knowledge. It is assembling the right context for AI reasoning. Users manually copy-paste from old chats, reopen long threads, search through files, re-explain background, and attach documents. This manual context construction is the new hidden labor of knowledge work.

## Why it matters

AI can synthesize, generate, and connect — but only if given the right input. The quality of AI output is directly proportional to the quality of assembled context. Bad context in, bad reasoning out.

## Connections

The core problem that [[context-composer|Context Composer]] solves. Why [[context-is-curation-not-search|Context is curation, not search]] matters. Creates demand for [[context-pack|Context Pack]] as a first-class object. Addressed by the [[propose-adjust-send|Propose → Adjust → Send]] interaction loop.

# Voice-to-Markdown Gateway
*◆ pattern*

The initial capture mechanism: a gateway that turns voice notes, AI conversations, and discussions into plain Markdown files. Frictionless capture into the [[immutable-raw-layer|Immutable Raw Layer]]. The wedge product — immediate utility before the full governed memory system exists.

## How it works

User speaks or records. System transcribes and stores as Markdown. No editing, no structuring required at capture time. AI later processes the raw capture to extract [[ai-proposes-memory-candidates|AI proposes memory candidates]].

## Connections

Phase 2 of the build sequence in [[Founder Roadmap]]. Feeds [[immutable-raw-layer|Immutable Raw Layer]]. Connects to [[anti-automation-pro-sovereignty|Anti-automation, pro-sovereignty]] via plain text output.

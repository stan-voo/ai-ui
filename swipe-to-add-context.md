# Swipe to Add Context
*◆ pattern*

The system proposes context suggestions ("Include last week's work?" "Include related decisions?") and the user swipes: yes, no, or later. This becomes a pre-flight checklist for context. The same swipe mechanic used in [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]] applied to context assembly.

## How it works

Quick yes/no/later gestures on mobile or desktop. Designed for speed — the user can curate 5-10 context items in under 5 seconds.

## Connections

Used in [[context-composer|Context Composer]]. Parallels [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]] swipe mechanic. Respects [[context-must-be-adjustable-in-under-5-seconds|Context must be adjustable in under 5 seconds]].

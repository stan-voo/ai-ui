# Thread Workspaces
*◇ concept*

Thread Workspaces are persistent, revisitable, accumulative spaces organized around a situation or evolving concern — not a file or folder. Each workspace contains conversations, notes, decisions, tasks, memories, and artifacts, all evolving together. They replace folders as the primary navigation unit.

## Why it matters

Matches how humans actually think (in situations, goals, open loops) rather than forcing them into storage primitives. Many important life and work threads never become "projects" but still need a home.

## Connections

Thread Workspaces are a core interface concept in the [[four-layer-architecture|Four-Layer Architecture]], serving as the second layer above plain text. They are distinct from projects — see [[thread-workspace-vs-project|Thread Workspace vs Project]] for why this distinction matters. The design implements the insight that [[humans-think-in-threads-not-files|Humans think in threads, not files]], giving persistent structure to ongoing concerns. The objects within a workspace become the raw material for [[context-pack|Context Pack]]s when it's time to engage AI reasoning.

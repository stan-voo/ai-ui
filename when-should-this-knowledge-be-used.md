# When should this knowledge be used?
*○ principle*

The fundamental question of PKM shifts from "Where should this note live?" to "When should this knowledge be used?" This reframing moves the focus from organization (spatial) to orchestration (temporal/contextual). Knowledge management becomes about surfacing the right information at the right moment.

## Why it matters

Traditional PKM forces users to solve an organizational problem. The new question dissolves that problem entirely — you don't need to organize if you can assemble context on demand.

## Connections

This is the core reframe of [[pkm-as-context-operating-system|PKM as Context Operating System]], shifting PKM from a filing system to an orchestration layer. It is answered concretely by [[context-pack|Context Pack]] and [[context-composer|Context Composer]], which give users tools to assemble the right knowledge at the right moment. This reframe also eliminates the friction described in [[structure-as-users-responsibility-fails|Structure as user's responsibility fails]], because the burden of upfront organization is replaced by just-in-time curation.

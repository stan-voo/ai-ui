# Immutable Raw Layer
*◇ concept*

The Immutable Raw Layer stores everything — voice notes, AI conversations, discussions, reasoning — as plain Markdown files. Nothing is filtered, summarized, or discarded at capture time. The raw data is portable, searchable, and vendor-independent.

## Why it matters

Capture should be frictionless and complete. Governance happens later, through [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]]. Premature filtering loses information; the raw layer ensures nothing valuable is accidentally discarded.

## Connections

This layer is the foundation of the [[four-layer-architecture|Four-Layer Architecture]], the bedrock on which all other layers build. It provides the input for [[ai-proposes-memory-candidates|AI proposes memory candidates]], where AI surfaces what might be worth promoting. Raw information can be captured through [[voice-to-markdown-gateway|Voice-to-Markdown Gateway]], keeping the capture friction near zero. Everything stored here feeds into [[the-new-knowledge-loop|The New Knowledge Loop]] as the starting material for AI-augmented reasoning.

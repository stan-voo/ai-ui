# PKM as Context Operating System
*◇ concept*

Personal Knowledge Management is evolving from a system for organizing notes into a Context Operating System for AI-assisted thinking. The core question shifts from "Where should this note live?" to "When should this knowledge be used?" PKM becomes the orchestration layer that assembles context for AI reasoning.

## Why it matters

Traditional PKM (folders, tags, links, graphs) was designed for human recall. In the AI era, the bottleneck is no longer structuring knowledge — it's assembling the right context for AI reasoning. The implication is radical: you don't need to organize if you can assemble context on demand.

## Connections

This reframes the role of tools like Obsidian from note repositories to context orchestration engines. The core question shift is expressed in [[when-should-this-knowledge-be-used|When should this knowledge be used?]], which replaces the old filing question entirely. The [[context-pack|Context Pack]] serves as the first-class object that makes this operating system tangible. The entire flow is described by [[the-new-knowledge-loop|The New Knowledge Loop]], where PKM orchestrates the cycle from raw capture through AI reasoning to trusted memory.

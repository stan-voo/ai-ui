# Trusted Knowledge Layer
*◇ concept*

The Trusted Knowledge Layer is what emerges when raw information passes through human-governed validation. Promoted memories are small, high-signal, linked to evidence, time-stamped, and auditable. It becomes a reliable context layer for both humans and AI agents.

## Why it matters

Without governance, AI memory accumulates noise and errors. Trust is not a binary gate — it is a confidence spectrum that rises with accumulated signals. Items can reach trusted status through a single strong signal (explicit review) or through accumulated weak signals (repeated use, no corrections, contextual inclusion). See [[implicit-validation-signals|Implicit Validation Signals]].

## Connections

The Trusted Knowledge Layer is built through [[human-in-the-loop-promotion|Human-in-the-loop promotion]] and [[implicit-validation-signals|Implicit Validation Signals]], governance mechanisms that separate signal from noise. It directly addresses the problems described in [[ai-memory-is-unreviewed|AI memory is unreviewed]] and [[context-rot|Context rot]], where unchecked memory degrades over time. It sits atop the [[immutable-raw-layer|Immutable Raw Layer]] as a curated elevation of what matters most. Within the [[four-layer-architecture|Four-Layer Architecture]], it represents the third layer — human-governed memory.

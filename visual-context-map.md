# Visual Context Map
*◆ pattern*

For long threads, a mini-map showing the structure of available context: Current thread → Decisions (3) → Documents (2) → Related threads (4) → Open questions (5). Users can toggle sections quickly. This replaces folder browsing with a semantic navigation structure.

## How it works

A collapsible tree view showing context objects grouped by type and relevance. Users expand/collapse sections and toggle items in/out of the [[context-pack|Context Pack]].

## Connections

Part of [[context-composer|Context Composer]]. Replaces folder navigation per [[files-are-storage-primitives-not-cognitive-primitives|Files are storage primitives, not cognitive primitives]]. Related to [[overlapping-contexts-replace-hierarchy|Overlapping contexts replace hierarchy]].

# Wardley Positioning of Context Composer
*concept*

The [[context-composer|Context Composer]] occupies the strategic sweet spot on a Wardley Map: **Custom → Product stage, high on the value chain** — the same position the original map identifies as "Vertical AI SaaS."

The key insight is that the original Wardley Map uses a different user anchor (SMBs wanting business outcomes) than this playbook (knowledge workers wanting better AI output). When the map is redrawn for the actual user, the Context Composer maps directly to the highest-opportunity zone: a productizable solution to [[context-assembly-is-the-new-bottleneck|context assembly friction]], sitting at the moment of use where users feel pain most acutely.

This positioning has three implications:

1. **It's not a platform play.** Unlike [[thread-workspaces|Thread Workspaces]] or [[pkm-as-context-operating-system|PKM as Context OS]] (both Genesis-stage, high-risk), the Context Composer is a direct-to-user product. The "platform fantasy" warnings from the AI business strategies analysis don't apply here.

2. **The services phase can be compressed.** Wardley's recommended path (Services → Product → SaaS) assumes the builder doesn't know the user's pain. But when the builder *is* the user, aggressive user research can replace literal consulting engagements. The build sequence in [[Founder Roadmap]] already reflects this.

3. **Context curation won't commoditize.** LLM APIs and infrastructure will. But the human judgment layer — the [[context-is-curation-not-search|curation]] that the [[propose-adjust-send|Propose → Adjust → Send]] flow embodies — is behavioral, not technical. This gives the Context Composer a durable moat that infrastructure players can't replicate.

The rest of the playbook ([[four-layer-architecture|Four-Layer Architecture]], [[memory-is-governance-not-storage|governed memory]]) represents strategic optionality — layers to build only when users pull toward them.
